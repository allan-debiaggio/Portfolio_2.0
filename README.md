# Portfolio 2.0 

Here is my real portfolio. For lack of time, I was using a template before, but I wanted to get back into a bit of HTML, CSS, maybe JavaScript. But most of all, I finally have a great idea of what I want it to be and look like, so it could be my project, that looks like me 😁
Here is the description of what I want as a final product 😎 :
  
## Specifications :  
  
- Old school design, UI, sounds and assets, reminiscing of Windows 95, but handmade (or AI made for music) 💾
- Sounds : Old-school mouseclick sound, static computer noise in the background and little jingle reminiscing of Windows 95 startup jingle 🔉
- Green - Blue plain colored background 📺
- Footer with start menu to the left, datetime and internet connexion to the right 📆
- Functions : About me 📑, Contact 📧, Sounds / music (turn on / off) 🔉, Projects 💿, Games 👾, Turn off 🌘
- Possibility to play at least one game in the browser - Minesweeper project for example would be nice and fit the rest 🎮 
- Possibility to turn on 🌞 or off 🌘 the computer, with this behavior :  
When accessing the website for the first time, a loading screen reminiscing of Windows 95 boot sequence displays, with CMOS battery and startup sound when desktop opens  
When clicking on "Turn off", computer shutdowns and after a few seconds, a pixel-art rendition of an old desktop computer shows up. If the user clicks on the power on button, the startup sequence starts again 👀
