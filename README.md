# Portfolio 2.0  
  
Here is my real portfolio. For lack of time, I was using a template before, but I wanted to get back into a bit of HTML, CSS, maybe JavaScript. But most of all, I finally have a great idea of what I want it to be and look like, so it could be my project, that looks like me 😁
Here is the description of what I want as a final product 😎 :
  
## Specifications :  
  
- Old school design, UI, sounds and assets, reminiscing of Windows 95, but handmade (or AI made for music) 💾
- Sounds : Old-school mouseclick sound, static computer noise in the background and little jingle reminiscing of Windows 95 startup jingle 🔉
- Green - Blue plain colored background 📺
- Footer with start menu to the left, datetime and internet connexion to the right 📆
- Functions : About me 📑, Contact 📧, Sounds / music (turn on / off) 🔉, Projects 💿 (Big projects on the desktop in individual folders, all the projects in a list with description accessed through Start menu), Games 👾, Language 🔠 (or parameters with sounds and language), Turn off 🌘
- Languages will be English, French, Spanish, Ukrainian
- Possibility to play at least one game in the browser - Minesweeper project for example would be nice and fit the rest 🎮 
- Possibility to turn on 🌞 or off 🌘 the computer, with this behavior :  
When accessing the website for the first time, a loading screen reminiscing of Windows 95 boot sequence displays, with CMOS battery and startup sound when desktop opens  
When clicking on "Turn off", computer shutdowns and after a few seconds, a pixel-art rendition of an old desktop computer shows up. If the user clicks on the power on button, the startup sequence starts again 👀
  
## Behavior :  
  
- Connecting to the website
- Booting sequence and into desktop, fullscreen (taking the whole page) with sounds and noises (Another page ?)
- User arrives into desktop (Homepage)
- Can use the webpage like a primitive old-school OS as described above
- All the options in start menu should open a window in the same homepage, even games. Windows should be resizable, dragged around, and minimized like an OS.
- Turn off : Shutting down sequence, landing on a black page with the pixel art computer where user can click on the buttons, play around and turn it on again (another page ?)
- The UX should be as smooth as possible. Maybe only one page with a lot of code that changes it ? Or multiple pages, but it should be fast and smooth, apart from the waiting time just to make the site feel "retro" and use the hourglass cursor.
  
## TODO order list :  
  
- Task bar (Start button and system tray with datetime)
- Custom logo for OS (Os Name : MacroWare Skylight - too professionnal 😒, Tinyware Peephole - better suited for me ✔️)
- Icons and other assets
- A few desktop images (A folder for each big project would be nice for example)
- Start menu & taskbar click behavior (opens a div with specs or datetime / calendar)
- Desktop icons click behavior
- Startup & shutdown behavior with interactive gif
- Minesweeper game implementation (probably in JavaScript)
